#A poison tree   
 
 ```
 
I told my wrath,my wrath did end.    
I was angry with my foe:             
I told it not,my wrath did grow   

And I watered it in fears,           
Night and morning with my tear;      
And I souned it with my smiles,      
And with soft deceitful wiles.  

And it grew both day and night,      
Till it bore an apple bright,        
And my foe beheld it shine,          
And he know that it was mine.   

And into my garden stole,            
When then night had veiled the pole; 
In the morning glad see,             
My foe outstretched beneath the tree.
